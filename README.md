## 1. Why can a city block be bad for UPS?

Take a close look at the drawing. The drawing shows a comparison of a typical city block with an optimized build.

Let's count the number of inserters:

24 fast inserters vs 6 stack inserters !

Players love fast inserters - they are cheap and beautiful :-)

But the stack size of the fast inserter is 3, versus 12.

And it turns out that for a city block, the inserters make 96 swings, and only 6 swings for an optimized build.

**96 swings vs 6 swings**

This is the main reason for poor UPS for city blocks!

And I forgot about the trains. Trains additionally reduce UPS.
